# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Veterinary)
##### 10/18/21

## Choosing a topic
The topic I decided on for my Freedom Project is veterinary animals. I chose this topic because I've always had a deep connection with animals and have grown up surrounded by them. Ever since I was little, I've always felt the need to take care of animals and make sure they're healthy and happy. Four years ago, I traveled to Mexico during my 6th grade summer break. I would save my lunch money from school so I could buy food there because it was cheaper there. With that money, I would feed the homeless dogs, cats and even roosters around my neighborhood. My grandma also owns horses,and whenever I visited, I would give them baths and take care of them. I still coninue to feed and care for animals whenever I can. These experiences made me realize how much I want to become a verterinarian someday so I can help animals live better lives and make a diffrence in my community. They were many multiple webistes and writtings that motivated me into the veterinary field. A great site that motivated me was,

Although I was also very interested in Fine Art and Cosmetics, I realized those are more like hobbies for me, Fine Art is something I find beautiful and relaxing, and I enjoy expressing creativity through it, but veterinary medicine feels like my true calling. Cosmetics is fun and very creative too, but nothing compares to they way i feel when I'm helping animals. Veterinary work simply overpowers my other interests. It's always in my mind and heart.

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem I've identified for my project is that many people don't realize how much,care,science,and dedication it takes to be a verterinarian or how important they are to both animals and people. I want explore how veterinarians help heal,protect,and comfort animals in different ways. 

In this stage, my goal is to research more about what veterinarians do daily, what kind of training they go through, and how they impact their communities. I also plan to learn how technology and compassion work together in modern veterinary care. Talking to my peers, teachers, and even local animal shelters will help me shape and strengthen my project's focus. 

## Skills
Various skills I've learned from working on this blog are time management, how to google, and communication.

#### Time management
Balancing this project with schoolwork and my personal life has taught me how to better manage my time. Between homework, responsibilities at home, and other activities, I decided to make a schedule that gives me certain hours each week to work on my project. This helps me stay productive,focused,and gives me enough time to write,research,and reflect on what I've learned. 

#### How to Google
When I started researching, I typed things like "How to become a veterinarian", "Daily life of a vet", and "Veterianry care for animals". At first, I got too many randoms results, but then I learned to refine searches. Changing my phrases to things like "veterinary careers" or "How veterinarians help communities" gave me much better results. I also looked for websites that ended in .edu, .org, or .gov to make sure the information was trustworhty. Some websites that strongly helped me where,

(https://nysvms.org/careers/)
(https://veterinary.stmatthews.edu/blog/what-is-life-like-as-a-vet).

#### Communication
Communication has also been really crucial. Since I'm working on this project alongisde classmates with diffrent topics or similar topics, we often will share advice and check in with each other. Having those conversations helps me stay inspired and keep learning from others while still focusing on my own topic. (https://schoolsuccessmakers.com/the-importance-of-communication-in-schools/) better explains it and goes into major important details. 

## Next steps 
Im excited to keep to keep researching and learning about veterinary medicine. My next steps are to look deeper into how veterinarians care for animals,the diffrent areas of veterinary work, and how techonologym such as X-rays and other advanced medical tools, helps them treat animals more effectively I want to learn how veterinarians balance science with compassions and how I can use that balance in my own life.

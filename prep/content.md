## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Technology plays a major role in modern veterinary medicine. Apps, tools, and machines help veterinarians improve accuracy, communication, patient monitoring, emergency care, and diagnostic precision. This project reviews existing veterinary software and hardware, that will continue to improve healthcare. 

## Least complex
<ul>
 &#9675; 1. <b><a href="https://vetcalculators.com/"> VetCalculator </a> (App)
</b>
</ul>

* Quick dosage calculator for vets and vet students

* Prevents medication errors 

* Works offline

* Free to download

* Designed for clinical/emergency accuracy.

* It performs one basic task (dose calculations) using simple formulas. No data storage, communication, or advanced systems involved.

<ul>
 &#9675; 2. <b><a href="https://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/"> Pet Poison Helpline </a> (App)
</b>
</ul>
 
* Gives info about toxic foods, plants, and chemicals.

* Included pictures of common toxins 

* Offers emergency steps

* Large searchable toxin database

* Works on phones and tablets

* It provides information only. It's helpful but still an informational tool, not a medical system.

## Ideas for Veterinary Technology 

 HOLO-VET SCANNER

* Creates 3D holograms of an animal's internal organs without surgery.
* Uses advanced sensors to scan through tissue safely.
* Helps vets diagnose injuries faster and with more accuracy.


 SMARTBANDAGE 

* Wraps around a wound and monitors swelling, temperature, and infection risk.
* Sends alerts to a vet's phone when conditions change.
* Automatically adjusts pressure to help healing. 


 PET EMOTIONS TRANSLATOR 

* Reads body signals, heart rate, and movement patterns to identify emotions.
* Shows if a pet is anxious, stressed, or in pain.
* Helps vets communicate better with animals during exams.

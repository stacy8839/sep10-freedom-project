## What I found: Veterinary Hardware & Software Innovations

Brief Introduction: I explored both software and hardware technologies that are transforming veterinary medicine. I understood how modern tools can help improve animal health care, prevent mistakes, and make treatments safer and faster. 

For software, I reviewed three major veterinaary apps: VetCalculator, PetDesk, and Pet Poison Helpline.
* VetCalculator helps veterinarians and vet students quickly calculate medication dosages for diffrent animals, including dogs, cats, and horses. It even works offline, which makes it very useful during emergencies.

* PetDesk connects pet owners directly with their veterinary clinics, allowing them to book appointments, refill prescriptions, and even keep track of medical records in one place.

* Pet Poison Helpline provides instant access to accurate information about toxic foods and chemicals for pets, created by licensed veterinarians and toxicologists.

These apps truly help improve accuracy, communication, and safety in daily vet work, showing how important software has become in modern clinics.

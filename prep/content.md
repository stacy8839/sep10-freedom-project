  &#9675; <b>First Hardware I reviewed was <a href="https://www.antechdiagnostics.com/antech-product/iv-pump/"> Intravenous (IV) Pumps</a> </b>
</ul>

&#9632; (https://www.antechdiagnostics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/vet-iv-hero.png)
   
&#9632; The pumps help deliver consistent flow of medications, fluids, and other essential supplements to animals during surgeries and recovery. 

&#9632; They help prevent medication mistakes by controlling dosage amounts precisely.

&#9632; Very lighweight for easy portable. Is about 2.6 pounds can fit in the palm of your hand.  

&#9632; Battery-operated and can last up to 8 hours per change, making it great for clinics without full-time power. 

&#9632; Supported by a "loaner pump" system that can run 24/7 if needed. 

&#9632;The thin and small compact form makes it easy to set up almost anywhere. (Like on a tabletop. hanging from a cage, or attached to an IV stand).

&#9632; Some models can record and store dosage data for digital touchscreens and alerts that remind the vet when the dose is done.

&#9632; Wireless IV pumps are being developed that connect to phones or tablets, so vets can monitor the patient remotely.

&#9632; Modern autoclaves have automatic drying features, which save time.

&#9632; They're eco-friendly, uses less water and power compared to older machines. 

&#9632; Makes sure tools are safe for every new patient, reducing disease spread. 

&#9632; Some even connect to Wi-Fi or networks to keep records of sterilization cycles. 

&#9632; Future autoclaves might even use UV-C light along with steam for extra sterilization power.

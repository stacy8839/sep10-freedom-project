# Entry 3: Brainstorming Innovative Veterinary Technologies (Part B)

## Brainstorming My ideas (Part B) 

For part B of this project, I brainstormed original veterinary technology ideas that do not currrently exist but could realistically be developed in the future. I started by thinking about common problems veterinarians face, such as difficulty diagnosing animals without invasive procedures, monitoring wounds after treatment, and understanding animals emotions during exams. From there, I focused on how technology could improve acccuracy, safety, and communication in veterinary care. 

* My first ideas is the **HoloVet Scanner**, a device that creates 3D holograms of an animal's internal organs without surgery. This technology would use advanced, safe sensores to scan through tissue, allowing veterinarians to see injuries or illnesses in real time. This could really help vets diagnose problems faster and more accurately while reducing stress and risk for animals. 

* My second idea is the **SmartBandage**, which wraps around a wound and actively monitors swelling, temperature changes, and signs of infection. The bandage would automatically adjust pressure to support healing and send alerts to a veterinarian's phone if something changes. This would be especially helpful for post-surgery recovery and ongoing wound care.

* My final idea is the **Pet Emotion Translator**, a tool that uses body signal, heart rate, and movement patterns to help identify an animal's emotional state. It could indicate whether a pet is anxious, stressed, or in pain, helping veterinarians communicate better with animals and provide more comfortable care during exams. 

After brainstorming these ideas, I refined them so they are clearly explained and ready to be added to the project website. 

## Sources: What I used to learn

Although these ideas are original, I used existing veterinary and medical technology as inspiration. I researched professional veterinary websites, medical imaging technologies such as <a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/hospital/diagnostic-imaging-services/xray"> X-rays </a> and <a href="https://www.atlanticcoastvet.com/site/pet-mri-long-island-vet"> MRI's, </a> and
<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11988085/"> articles about wearable health monitoring devices for animals.</a> These sources helped me understand what technology already exists and how it could be improved or adapted into new innovations. 

## Engineering Design Process (EDP) 

At this stage, I am in the **research and brainstorming stage of the engineering design process**. I identified problems in veterinary medicine and generated several possible solutions. My **next step** in the engineering design process will be to evaluate these ideas more closely and choose one to develop further by considering cost and real-world application.

## SKills Developed 

SInce my previous entry, I have developed several **skills**, including **creative problem-solving** and **critical thinking**. I practiced **identifying real-world problems** and **designing realistic solutions** based on existing technology, I also improved my research and organization skills by clearly structuring my ideas and preparing them for presentation on a website.

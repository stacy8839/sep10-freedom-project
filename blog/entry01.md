# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Veterinary)
##### 10/18/21

## Choosing a topic
The topic I decided on for my Freedom Project is veterinary animals. I chose this topic because Ive always had a depp connection with animals, I have grown up surrounded by them. Ever since I was little, ive always had the need to take care of animals and making sure there healhty and happy. 4 years ago I traveled to Mexico during my 6th grade summer break. I would save my lunch money from school in order to buy food because it was cheaper there. I would feed the homeless dogs, cats and even roosters in my neighborhood. My grandma also owns horses, and I would take them regularly baths whenever I visited. I still coninue to feed and help animals whenever I can. These experiments made me realize how much I want to become a verterinarian someday so I can help animals live better lives and make a diffrence in my community.
